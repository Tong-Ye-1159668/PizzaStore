# PizzaStore

PizzaStore is a sample API built using the minimal API template for .NET 8.

## About This Project

This project is part of the MSA (Microsoft Student Accelerator) learning process to understand Minimal API in .NET 8. It demonstrates how to build an API with only a few lines of code, covering key features such as dependency injection, database access, and route management. Unlike controller-based APIs, minimal APIs require you to explicitly specify the routes you need, providing a hands-on approach to API development.

## Features

- CRUD operations for pizza resources (create, read, update, delete)
- Swagger integration for easy API documentation and testing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the project using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI:
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project PizzaStore/PizzaStore.csproj
   ```
3. Access the API at `http://localhost:5068` (or the port specified in your launch settings).
4. Use Swagger UI at `/swagger` for interactive API documentation.
